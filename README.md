This project was created in November 2023 and released to the public in September 2024. Inspiration was taken from [Universal-Unity-ESP](https://github.com/ethanedits/Universal-Unity-ESP).

## Usage

1. Download the pre-compiled DLL files from the [releases page](https://github.com/k4yt3x/LethalESP/releases/latest); or
2. Compile the project with Visual Studio. You will need to adjust the assembly references and the output path.
3. Copy the output DLL files to the game's plugin directory like you would with normal plugins (e.g. `%AppData%\r2modmanPlus-local\LethalCompany\profiles\Default\BepInEx\plugins\LethalESP` if you use r2modman).
4. Use `F10`, `F11`, and `F12` to toggle enemy, map hazards, and loot ESP.

## Misc

> Why did you release a cheat for a multiplayer game?

I normally don't. Lethal Company's environment is a bit different. There are already plenty of balance-breaking mods widely available (e.g., minimap), to the extend that I think the value of releasing this code for educational purposes surpasses the value of keeping it private.
